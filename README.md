# 🌐 Spencer | Freelance Website Demo

A clean, modern, responsive React + TailwindCSS demo site built to showcase how small and local businesses can benefit from an effective online presence. Designed and developed by **Spencer**, a freelance web designer committed to helping entrepreneurs stand out online — without the tech overwhelm.

## 🧠 Why This Demo?

Many small businesses and local shops either:

- Don’t have a website at all,
- Are relying on outdated templates,
- Or depend entirely on social media for visibility.

This project shows what your business **could look like online** — professionally designed, fast, mobile-ready, and easy to navigate. Whether you're a food spot, tobacco store, personal trainer, barber, or a seasonal vendor (like fireworks stands), your customers expect to find you online.

> **Let me help you make that first impression count.**
